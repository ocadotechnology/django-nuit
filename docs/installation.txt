Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Nuit is built using SASS_, and requires that you install the SASS binary in order to compile and compress the CSS. This won't be installed using ``pip``, and will need to be installed manually.

Installation
------------

* Install Nuit with ``pip``::

    pip install django-nuit

* Add the following to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'nuit',
        'compressor',
        'foundation_scss',
        'foundation_icons',
        'jquery',
    )

* Add the context processor to your settings::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS += (
        'nuit.context_processors.nuit',
    )

* Add the following settings for django-compressor_ (see their documentation for more detail)::

    
    # Add 'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder' to STATICFILES_FINDERS

    COMPRESS_ENABLED = True
    COMPRESS_OFFLINE = True

    COMPRESS_PRECOMPILERS = (
        ('text/x-sass', 'sass {infile} {outfile}'),
        ('text/x-scss', 'sass {infile} {outfile}'),
    )

* Run ``collectstatic`` and ``compress``::

    manage.py collectstatic
    manage.py compress

* You're now ready to start using Nuit in your templates and apps.

Dependencies
------------

In case you're installing Nuit differently (e.g. from the git repo), make sure to install the following dependencies.

- django_

  Fairly obvious - this is a Django library, afterall::

      pip install django

- django-compressor_

  In order to compile the CSS used by Nuit::

      pip install django-compressor

- django-foundation-statics_

  Nuit provides a suite to tools to help you easily build a consistent front-end interface for your Django application using Zurb's Foundation_ framework. This package contains the static files (CSS, Javscript) that makes up that framework::

      pip install django-foundation-statics

- django-foundation-icons_

  This package contains Zurb's `Foundation Icons`_ static files::

      pip install django-foundation-icons
