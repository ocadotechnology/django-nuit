Forms
=====

Foundation's `form component`_ is complex and provides many options. The :ref:`template-tag-foundation-form` template tag enables you to render your Form_ objects with complete control over their layout.

.. _forms-basic-usage:

Basic Usage
-----------

To use the template tag at it's most basic, don't provide any options between the open and closing tags, and pass your ``Form`` object::

    <form>
    {% foundation_form my_form_object %}
    {% end_foundation_form %}
    </form>

This will render all your specified form fields at full width. (In Foundation's grid_ terms, this means they are defined as ``small-12``, ``medium-12`` and ``large-12``.)

.. note::
    Just like Django's own form rendering, the template tag will not render the opening and closing ``<form>`` elements, or the submit button. That's up to you.

.. _forms-layout-customisation:

CSRF
----

By default, the :ref:`template-tag-foundation-form` template tag will insert the :ref:`csrf_token <django:using-csrf>` required by :py:class:`django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware`. If you're not using this middleware, or don't want the token itself, you can set :attr:`csrf_enabled` to ``False`` in the tag:

    {% foundation_form my_form_object csrf_enabled=False %}
    {% end_foundation_form %}

Layout Customisation
--------------------

To customise which fields appear next to each other in the form, specify each row as a semi-colon-separated list between the form tags. For example, for a imaginary 'Customer' form::

    {% foundation_form customer_form %}
        title; first_name; last_name
        email_address;
        password; confirm_password;
    {% end_foundation_form %}

This will render the ``title``, ``first_name`` and ``last_name`` fields at equal widths on one row, the ``email_address`` field on it's own row, and then the two ``password`` fields equal width on the final row. Again, in Foundation's grid terms, this means that the three first-row fields will have ``small-12``, ``medium-4`` and ``large-4``, the ``email_address`` is ``small-12`` etc., and the ``password`` fields are ``small-12``, ``medium-6`` and ``large-6`` etc.

Any fields you do not specify will be appended to the end of the form at full width.

.. note::
    No matter which fields you specify on each line, Nuit will default all fields to their own line for small screens (``small-12``). This can be overriden - see the :ref:`forms-custom-widths` section.

.. _forms-custom-widths:

Custom Widths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to rely on Nuit's automatic spacing of fields (for example, you know that the ``title`` field really out to be smaller than the ``field_name`` and ``last_name`` fields), you can provide a :py:class:`dict` of options after each field containing values for either ``small``, ``medium`` or ``large`` depending on what you want to override. For example, to make the ``title`` field take up 2 columns at medium-up, use the following markup::

    
    {% foundation_form customer_form %}
        title {'medium': 2}; first_name; last_name
        email_address;
        password; confirm_password;
    {% end_foundation_form %}

Nuit will automatically space out unspecified width fields as best it can to fill the remaining space.

.. _forms-custom-widths-inheritance:

.. note::
    Just like Foundation, widths defined for smaller sizes will be inherited by larger sizes. In the example above, even though we only specify the ``medium`` value, the ``title`` field also take a width of ``2`` at ``large`` sizes. If you don't want this behaviour, then either set the larger sizes manually, or set the next size up to ``0`` to let Nuit calculate the spacings.

.. _forms-pre-post-fix-labels:

Pre- and Post-fix Labels
------------------------

Foundation allows you to define `pre- and post-fix labels`_ that attach to form inputs. One example of such usage is prepending a ``http://`` before an input asking for a URL (note that this data is **not** included in the submitted data). Nuit lets you define this in the field's data :py:class:`dict`::
    
    {% foundation_form customer_form %}
        title; first_name; last_name
        email_address {'postfix': '@gmail.com'};
        password {'prefix': '6 chars or less'}; confirm_password;
    {% end_foundation_form %}

.. _`pre- and post-fix labels`: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/forms.html#pre-postfix-labels-amp-actions

.. _forms-pre-post-custom-widths:

Custom Widths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, each pre- or post-fix label will take up 3 of the 12 available grid widths at all sizes, and the field will take up 9. This can be customised in exactly the same way as for fields, detailed above in :ref:`forms-custom-widths`. Add options to the :py:class:`dict` of ``prefix_small``, ``prefix_medium``, ``prefix_large``, ``postfix_small``, ``postfix_medium`` and ``postfix_large``::

    {% foundation_form customer_form %}
        title; first_name; last_name
        email_address {'postfix': '@gmail.com', 'postfix_medium': 4};
        password {'prefix': '6 chars or less'}; confirm_password;
    {% end_foundation_form %}

The same rules for inheritance apply as in the :ref:`note <forms-custom-widths-inheritance>` above.
